Hi, I am Gaowei Xu (徐高伟), I graduated from the School of Electronic Science and Engineering of Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 2013 with a bachelor's degree in electronic science and technology. In the second half of 2013, I obtained the postgraduate qualification without examination and entered the State Key Laboratory of Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) and Systems at Fudan University to study digital integrated circuit design. My postgraduate topics are machine learning machine algorithms and VLSI acceleration, biological signal processing and circuit implementation.

After graduation, I worked for Intel, BMW Group, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and smart Automobile. I have more than 8 years of working experience on the fields of artificial intelligence (AI), deep learning, robotics, autonomous driving, and cloud computing.Currently, I am a senior engineer at NVIDIA Corp, focusing on the fields of AI, autonomous driving and heterogeneous computing (Embedded CPU + GPU, cluster cloud-based, etc.). I have excellent communication skills in both English and Mandarin (both oral and written) and rich Experience of joint-development & cooperation with global team.

Outside of academia, I have a passion for cooking, traveling, and swimming. In terms of my life goals, I aspire to have a fulfilling career in a field that I am passionate about. I also strive to make a positive impact by helping others realize their full potential.
